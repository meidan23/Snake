# Snake

This repository contains the source code for a classic snake game developed using Pygame. The game window is set to 300x300 pixels and the snake starts with a length of three segments. The player controls the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and the goal is to eat as much food as possible to increase the length of the snake without colliding with the edges of the game window or the snake's own body.

If the player collides with the edge of the game window or the snake's body, the game ends and a game over screen is displayed with the player's score. The game over screen allows the player to replay the game by clicking a "Replay" button.

The repository contains a single Python file containing the source code for the game, along with comments explaining the various parts of the code. The repository could be useful for anyone looking to learn Pygame or to develop a similar game.
